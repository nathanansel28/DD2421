Assignment 4

When information gain is maximised, the entropy of the subset is the smallest.

The attribute that gives the greatest information gain should be picked.

Entropy is the measure of uncertainty. Thus, the smaller the entropy of a dataset, 
the lesser the uncertainty it has.  From equation 3, in order for information gain
to be maximised, the entropy of the subset must be much smaller value in comparison to
the entropy of the whole dataset. We can then use information gain to pick the attribute for
splitting because, the smaller the entropy of the subset, the smaller uncertainty it has
thus giving greater information gain and a better attribute for splitting.
